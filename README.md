# Webscraper

Made with Python using the BeautifulSoup4, lmxl and request libraries,
this webscraper can be used to target the job-boards via interactive inputs and get:
- the job title
- the required skills
- the link to the job

the webscraper stores this data in a folder it creates and then stores the different jobs in their txt files
The user can  use this link to directly apply for the jobs.

The code will need to be tweaked if you want to use it for different job boards because of the HTML Tags associated
and because different sites have different layout.
